# Golden Mean Analysis

Find the virtuous middle between two extremes—one of excess, one of deficiency—relative to person and circumstance.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Am I doing too much or too little of X?"
- Request for "finding the right balance" or "the golden mean"
- Someone describes swinging between extremes
- Behavioral or decision-making question where moderation matters
- Request to identify the virtuous approach to a situation
- Someone is unsure whether to do more or less of something

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| trait_or_behavior | Yes | The quality, behavior, or approach to analyze |
| context | No | Specific situation or circumstances (affects relative mean) |
| person_factors | No | Relevant characteristics of the person (experience, role, etc.) |

## The Golden Mean Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Spectrum

Every virtue exists on a spectrum between two vices:

```
DEFICIENCY ←————— MEAN ————→ EXCESS
   (Vice)        (Virtue)      (Vice)
```

**Key principle:** The mean is not arithmetic—it is the right amount for this person in this situation. Courage is closer to recklessness than to cowardice; generosity is closer to prodigality than to stinginess.

### Step 2: Name the Extremes

For the trait or behavior in question, identify:

1. **The Vice of Deficiency** - Too little of this quality
   - What it looks like in behavior
   - What problems it causes
   - How others perceive it

2. **The Vice of Excess** - Too much of this quality
   - What it looks like in behavior
   - What problems it causes
   - How others perceive it

### Step 3: Define the Mean (Virtue)

The mean is characterized by:
- Right amount
- Right time
- Right manner
- Right object (toward the right things/people)
- Right purpose

**Ask:** "What would a person of practical wisdom do in this situation?"

### Step 4: Locate the Person's Current Position

Determine where the person currently falls on the spectrum:
- Are they closer to deficiency or excess?
- Is their tendency consistent or situational?
- What triggers their movement toward extremes?

### Step 5: Provide Calibration Guidance

Based on their current position:
- If deficient: Lean toward (but not into) excess to find the mean
- If excessive: Pull back toward (but not into) deficiency
- Include specific behavioral indicators they've found the mean

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Golden Mean Analysis: [Trait/Behavior]

### The Spectrum

| Deficiency | Mean (Virtue) | Excess |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| [Vice name] | [Virtue name] | [Vice name] |
| [Description] | [Description] | [Description] |

### Vice of Deficiency: [Name]
**Manifests as:** [specific behaviors]
**Problems caused:** [consequences]
**How perceived:** [how others see it]

### Vice of Excess: [Name]
**Manifests as:** [specific behaviors]
**Problems caused:** [consequences]
**How perceived:** [how others see it]

### The Virtuous Mean: [Name]
**Characterized by:**
- The right amount: [specifics]
- At the right time: [when to act]
- In the right manner: [how to act]
- Toward the right objects: [what/whom to direct it toward]

### Your Current Position
[Assessment of where they currently fall]

### Calibration Guidance
[Specific advice for finding the mean from their current position]

**Signs you've found the mean:**
- [Indicator 1]
- [Indicator 2]
- [Indicator 3]

*"Anybody can become angry—that is easy. But to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not within everybody's power and is not easy."*
```

## Classic Mean Examples

| Deficiency | Virtue (Mean) | Excess |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| Cowardice | Courage | Recklessness |
| Insensibility | Temperance | Self-indulgence |
| Stinginess | Generosity | Prodigality |
| Self-deprecation | Truthfulness | Boastfulness |
| Boorishness | Wit | Buffoonery |
| Apathy | Proper concern | Anxiety |
| Passivity | Assertiveness | Aggression |
| Rigidity | Flexibility | Inconsistency |
| Aloofness | Friendliness | Obsequiousness |
| Negligence | Diligence | Workaholism |

---

## Constraints

- The mean is relative to person and situation—do not prescribe universal rules
- Some things have no mean (murder, theft, adultery are always wrong)
- The mean in character differs from the mean in action
- Do not confuse the mean with mediocrity or lack of commitment
- Acknowledge when the right course leans closer to one extreme

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm told I'm too direct in meetings—I just say what I think. But I don't want to become one of those people who never shares their real opinion. What's the right balance?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Golden Mean Analysis: Directness in Communication

### The Spectrum

| Deficiency | Mean (Virtue) | Excess |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| Reticence/Evasiveness | Candor | Tactlessness |
| Withholding truth | Appropriate honesty | Brutal honesty |

### Vice of Deficiency: Reticence
**Manifests as:** Withholding opinions, vague or hedging statements, avoiding difficult truths, saying what others want to hear
**Problems caused:** Issues fester unaddressed, trust erodes when others sense withholding, poor decisions made without full information
**How perceived:** Untrustworthy, passive, political, or simply disengaged

### Vice of Excess: Tactlessness
**Manifests as:** Stating opinions without regard for timing, audience, or manner; prioritizing "being honest" over being effective; dismissing others' feelings as irrelevant
**Problems caused:** Relationships damaged, ideas rejected due to delivery, others become defensive rather than receptive
**How perceived:** Abrasive, arrogant, lacking emotional intelligence

### The Virtuous Mean: Candor
**Characterized by:**
- **The right amount:** Share what is genuinely useful, not every thought that passes through your mind
- **At the right time:** After listening, when the other party is receptive, not in the heat of conflict
- **In the right manner:** With respect for the dignity of others, framed constructively, owning it as your perspective
- **Toward the right objects:** Direct feedback to those who can act on it, not complaints about people to others

### Your Current Position
Based on feedback, you lean toward excess—toward tactlessness. Your instinct to share openly is valuable, but the delivery may undermine the reception. The issue is likely manner and timing more than amount.

### Calibration Guidance
You do not need to share less—you need to share differently:
1. **Pause before speaking:** Ask yourself "What is my purpose?" If it's to vent, wait. If it's to improve something, proceed with care.
2. **Adjust for audience:** The same truth can be delivered with more or less cushioning depending on who needs to hear it and their current state.
3. **Lead with inquiry:** Instead of "This won't work," try "I'm concerned about X—can we examine it?" Same truth, different frame.
4. **Private vs. public:** Critical feedback often lands better one-on-one than in group settings.

**Signs you've found the mean:**
- People seek your opinion because they know you'll be honest
- Your feedback leads to change rather than defensiveness
- You feel authentic without feeling combative
- Others describe you as "candid but thoughtful"

*The person of practical wisdom speaks truth in the manner most likely to be received, knowing that unheard truth serves no one.*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Aristotle** expert persona. Use it when analyzing behavioral tendencies, seeking balance in approach, or making decisions about "how much" of something. It pairs well with:
- **virtue-ethics-assessment** for deeper ethical analysis
- **first-principles-reasoning** to examine why the extremes are problematic
